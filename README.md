# TranslatorsManagement

Simple API with simple Blazor webassembly frontend

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022
- .net 5.0 sdk (for API)
- .net 7.0 sdk (for Blazor frontend)


## How to run

- open solution in visual studio
- run TranslationManagement.Api
- run TranslationManagement.Web

## What is different

### used patterns:

- repository
- facade
- strategy
- DI


### changes:

- code refactored, deleted code coupling from controllers, separation of concerns (dbcontext shouldn't be called from controllers, controllers should only delegate responsibilities)

- introduces enums intead of strings for job and translation statuses

- added some db migrations

- implemented layered architecture - created of DAL (data access layer), web API layer, test layer

- introduced connection string for database from configuration file (best practice, we want to hide possible passwords for db)

- JobFileReader implemented with strategy pattern for extendability

- added some RESTFUL principles -- now API returns HTTP returns codes based on request

- implemented few tests
    - example test for repository
    - example test for jobreader

- autogenerated api client using NSwag

- added Cors to Api

- simple UI for creation of translators

## what can be more improved

- more edge cases can be considered for API
- better responses, which consider more edgecases
- implemented custom DTOs with entity mappings for UI requirements
- data validations should be introduced


A lot of stuff can be still improved, but now it should be much better than at beginning.

# notes

I was considering doing UI in React, however it would take a lot of time, as I'm still in learning phase, so I've chosen faster approach
